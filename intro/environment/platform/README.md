**Computing Power or Cloud Service the platform will provided：**

**Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud** (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction.

**Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means the contestants can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as websites, mobile applications, backup and restore and archive .
