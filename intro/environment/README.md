# Competition Environment

Due the global impact of Covid-19, we have chosen to conduct this year's chengdu80 tournament online. To do so, we provided a cloud-based competition environment where teams around the world could choose the **nearest** available area to access computing power and release prototypes.

Under the rule of fairness and justice, participants should compete in the environment provided, via the following steps:

* Connect to the designated network; 
* Connect to the designated servers\(EC2\) ; 
* Develop, deploy and demonstrate the project in the designated servers.

Each team will be provided with two servers \(Windows 2016 or Ubuntu 18.04 or Centos7\).  Participants should develop and deploy under the given environment.   
All operations will be recorded.

To introduce the completion of the project, the following information is provided:

* [Platform](platform.md)
* [Configuration](configuration.md)
* [Limit](limit.md)
