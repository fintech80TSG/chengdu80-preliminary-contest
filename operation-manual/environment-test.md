# Environment Test

In the pre-match testing session, we need to do the following tests. 1. verify if the aws console login is working properly and if the team introduction video can be uploaded via S3. 2. check whether the server operating system is correct and whether it can be logged on normally 3. verify that the connection speed to the server is normal and that there is no lag.

## 3.1 Test connection to EC2

{% hint style="warning" %}
Due to regional restrictions, the server addresses of the following teams are **different \(Using** [**GA service**](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/global-accelerator/?blogs-global-accelerator.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&blogs-global-accelerator.sort-order=desc&aws-global-accelerator-wn.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&aws-global-accelerator-wn.sort-order=desc)**\),** so emailed account information should be noted.

It is recommended that you use the connection information provided by mail.

**1.Connect to Centos7 or Ubuntu18.04 LTS**

**\(Note:**putty is not a designated SSH tool, other login methods are allowed\)

**Connect using PuTTY**

a. Download and install PuTTY from the [PuTTY download page](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/).

b.Start PuTTY \(from the **Start** menu, choose **All Programs, PuTTY, PuTTY**\).

c.In the **Category** pane, choose **Session** and complete the following fields:

a.run puttygen.exe,load `.pem`file change to`.ppk` file.

* From the **Start** menu, choose **All Programs**, **PuTTY**, **PuTTYgen**.
* Under **Type of key to generate**, choose **RSA**. If you're using an older version of PuTTYgen, choose **SSH-2 RSA**.

  ```text
                              ![
                        RSA key in PuTTYgen
                    ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/puttygen-key-type.png)
  ```

* Choose **Load**. By default, PuTTYgen displays only files with the extension `.ppk`. To locate your `.pem` file, choose the option to display files of all types.

  ```text
                              ![
                        Select all file types
                    ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/puttygen-load-key.png)
  ```

* Select your `.pem` file for the key pair that you specified when you launched your instance and choose **Open**. PuTTYgen displays a notice that the `.pem` file was successfully imported. Choose **OK**.
* To save the key in the format that PuTTY can use, choose **Save private key**. PuTTYgen displays a warning about saving the key without a passphrase. Choose **Yes**.

b.In the **Host Name** box: public ip\(ipv4\).

c.In the **Port Name** box: 22

d.Select **Connection** -&gt; **SSH** -&gt; **Auth**,browse the `.ppk` file.

```text
e.Click **Open**.
```

{% hint style="info" %}
\(Optional\) You can configure PuTTY to automatically send 'keepalive' data at regular intervals to keep the session active. This is useful to avoid disconnecting from your instance due to session inactivity. In the **Category** pane, choose **Connection**, and then enter the required interval in the **Seconds between keepalives** field. For example, if your session disconnects after 10 minutes of inactivity, enter 180 to configure PuTTY to send keepalive data every 3 minutes.
