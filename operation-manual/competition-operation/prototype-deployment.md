# Prototype Deployment

**The online competition server not only provides practice and training, but also serves as a server for prototype deployment. The jury looks at both the prototype deployment and the code used to complete this prototype deployment.** I**t is recommended that all operations are done in the competition environment.** 

The security group port is only set by the organizing committee during the competition and cannot be viewed.

To ensure that your service starts up properly, each team needs to **apply for the required open port** on Slack.

Each team should ensure that the server can be restarted automatically at the end of the game.

You should start your server on these Ports（60-9000）.If your team need special ports,plz [Contact us.](../../tech-support/online-support.md)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
To ensure that the server is running properly during the defense, please configure your own robustness code \(shutdown self-start configuration\).
