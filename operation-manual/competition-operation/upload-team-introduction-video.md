# Project Intro Video Upload

You need to use Amazon S3 to upload Project Intro Video after Access to Account \(if you don't know how to access, please return [Access to Account](../sign-console.md)\).You can upload project intro video  to the "fintech80chengdu-project-intro-upload"  S3 bucket. The specific upload steps are the same as [Team Intro Video Upload](../upload-team-introduction-video.md).

Teams competing onsite are no longer required to upload a project introduction video ,but the slides need to be uploaded to github along with the code.
